this is a grouping of some of the java files written during my software automation class. 

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
i can do this by writing solid tests, testing early, and testing often. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
i must be sure to ask probing questions so that i understand the user needs on a detailed level. user need research and implementation is an iterative process, not a linear one. each successive attempt is aimed to improve on the previous. 

How do I approach designing software?
i am more of an Object Oriented Design person. i wrote a lot of Ruby when i was a coder, and the 'Objects, Classes, Inheritance, etc' really stuck with me.
